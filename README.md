# Design Principle and Methods Robot Competition

In a team of 6, we designed a robot, on a grid floor, which can search for colored rings, pick them up and navigate back. 

The robot receives some points data (random generated), which indicates the border of which the robot cannot step into, the location of bridge, and the estimate location of the colored rings. The robot finishes localization, navigating to bridge, crossing the bridge, searching for rings, collecting rings, and navigating back within 5 mins.
